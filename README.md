# Face Recognition Using Haar Cascade Model

In this project, I developed a face recognition system leveraging the Haar Cascade model. The primary goal was to accurately identify and distinguish between the faces of three prominent individuals: Barack Obama, Sachin Tendulkar, and Lionel Messi. The model utilizes Haar-like features and cascade classifiers to detect and recognize faces within images.

Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language for model development.
OpenCV: Utilized for implementing the Haar Cascade model and image processing.
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for model training and evaluation.
Image Dataset: Curated dataset comprising images of Barack Obama, Sachin Tendulkar, and Lionel Messi.
